                    Matthew and Mary were married in Bridgewater in 1784 and the
                    older four of their ten children were born there. Matthew
                    died in 1815 and Many about 1829? Matthew Bryant and Mary

                    1791. On their death George held the lease of Curry Pool
                    Farm.

                  <CardText>
                    George was born in 1789. George still the lease of Curry
                    Pool the property until it was sold in October 1833 and he
                    was 44. George and his family sailed to join his brothers in
                    Van Diemen’s Land aboard the Sarah, a ship of 488 tons. She
                    sailed from London on 14 October 1834 and arrived in Hobart
                    on 14 February 1835. George Bryant had married Ann Legg in
                    Bristol in 1811 and they had ten children between 1812 and
                    1833. It would appear that George and his family lived with
                    his brother Francis at ‘Redlands’, Plenty, for some years
                    after arrival in Van Diemen’s Land, probably until Francis
                    left ‘Redlands’ on expiration of the lease at the end of
                    1841. George died in Hobart on 8 November 1853. His wife Ann
                    Legg seems to have gone to live with her son James in
                    Victoria soon after. She died on 7 December 1867 aged 77, at
                    his property, Frogmoor Farm, Yarram Creek.

                  Francis Bryant
                  <CardText>
                    Francis Bryant was born in 1795. Francis had married Jane
                    Carver about 1815. They sailed to Van Diemen's Land with
                    their five children and had a further six children in
                    Tasmania. On 20 August 1845, Francis offered 2,186 acres at
                    Jerusalem for lease. It is not clear when Francis and his
                    family left Tasmania for Victoria but it may well have been
                    about this time. By daughter Eliza’s account, they certainly
                    were living in Melbourne, in 1850/51. The Victorian
                    Electoral Rolls for 1856/57 show Francis Bryant, Gentleman,
                    at 27 La Trobe Street, Melbourne. His wife, Jane Carver,
                    died on 15 March 1857 at Victoria Street, Melbourne, aged
                    65. Francis Bryant of Spaxton Cottage, South Yarra,
                    Melbourne, born Charlinch, Som- erset, late of Surrey,
                    gentleman aged 63, married Lucy Matilda (neé Marzetti), aged
                    38, widow of George John Marzetti on 9 March 1859 at Christ
                    Church, South Yarra. A Marzetti family was prominent in the
                    New Norfolk area in Tasmania. Francis Bryant died in London,
                    England, on 29 January 1863.

                  <CardText>
                    James Bryant was born in 1799. Of the brothers, James and
                    Edmund, both bachelors, went first. They wrote jointly, from
                    Guild Hall Coffee Shop, London, to Earl Bathurst on 25 April
                    1823, soliciting a land grant in Tasmania. Their letter of
                    recommendation to Lieutenant Governor Sorell was dated 30
                    April 1823. They sailed in the ship Aguilar, 432 tons, and
                    arrived in Hobart on 4 February 1824. After arrival in
                    Hobart with about £1,000 capital each, James and Edmund
                    Bryant took up land near Jericho. This is about seventy
                    kilometres by road north of Hobart. Even forty years later
                    it was fairly wild country. James was granted 800 acres and
                    Edmund 700. Afterwards they were to receive further grants
                    of 700 and 800 acres on account of additional stock
                    imported. Lengthy sea voyages or a lonely life in the bush
                    are good for romance. In October 1824 in Hobart, James
                    Bryant married Ann Roe, the widow of Thomas Roe, another
                    passenger on the Aguilar who had died on the voyage.

                  Edmund Bryant
                  <CardText>
                    Edmund Bryant was born in 1803. Edmund had departed again
                    for England in the brig Woodlark, 196 tons, on 4 April 1824.
                    There he married Jane Mogg by licence on 15 February 1825 at
                    St Mary’s Church, Bridgwater. They were to have seven
                    children. Edmund arrived back in Hobart in the brig
                    Mountaineer on 24 October 1825, with his bride, and Francis
                    Bryant, with his wife and five children. They brought
                    pure-bred sheep and cattle and a two- year-old thoroughbred
                    stallion as well as goods for sale. The brothers did much
                    jointly and had a store in Hobart which was also a butchery
                    at one stage. They imported pure-bred sheep and cattle and
                    ran stock on their various properties. It seems James and
                    Edmund ran their properties at Jericho jointly. However,
                    before James died on 27 January 1833, Edmund had leased
                    ‘Trafalgar’ at Evandale and was in occupation by October
                    1831. He was to run other properties later. As Edmund Bryant
                    imported the first thoroughbred stallion, Viscount, it seems
                    likely that the brothers were much involved in racing. In
                    spite of Governor Arthur’s dis- approval, there had been a
                    day of horse racing on the Fourteen Tree Plain, Jericho as
                    far back as 3rd April, 1826. The day following these races a
                    meeting was held at Jericho at which it was unanimously
                    decided to form a Turf Club with a limit of fifty members.
                    This was the foundation of the Tasmanian Turf Club and was
                    the first club in V.D.L. to use the word “Tasmanian”.

                  Thomas Nicholsan Hollingworth
                  <CardText>
                    THOMAS Nicholson Hollingworth, the founder of the
                    Hollingworth family in our area, was a convict sentenced in
                    1836 to life imprisonment for stealing a gun and a coat.
                    When he arrived in New South Wales he was assigned to the
                    Busby Brothers as a labourer and came with them to the
                    Richmond River about 1844. He obtained his Ticket of Leave
                    soon afterwards in 1845 and remained in the area when the
                    Busby Brothers left. He received his conditional pardon in
                    1853. In 1847 he married Ann King at Grafton. Thomas and Ann
                    Hollingworth moved to Lismore possibly to be closer to her
                    family. Thomas obtained a 92-acre conditional purchase
                    property just west of the Richmond River and on the southern
                    side of a creek leading into the Richmond. This property is
                    now part of South Lismore and the creek is called
                    Hollingworth Creek, after Thomas. The Bruxner Highway
                    crosses Hollingworth Creek and for many years the bridge was
                    labelled "Hollingsworth Creek" (with an "s"), much to the
                    disgust of family members. A campaign, led by descendant
                    Nicholson (Nick) Hollingworth, had the "s" removed in recent
                    years. Thomas and Ann's second son, Joseph Nicholson
                    Hollingworth, initially worked for his uncle, Thomas King,
                    at Woodburn.

                    the river at Tucki where they were loaded onto sailing ships
                    or rafted downstream. Later he worked for William Yabsley at
                    Coraki as a sawyer.

                    Thomas King was the brother to William and therefore the
                    uncle to their children. Thomas King had been apprenticed as
                    a shipwright to William Yabsley. Yabsley had provided a
                    tutor to educate his apprentices as well as giving them a
                    sound knowledge of their craft. Much of this knowledge was
                    passed on by Thomas King to Joseph Hollingworth who some
                    time later took up an apprenticeship with sawmill owner,
                    J.E. Glasgow, at Lismore. He eventually became a millwright
                    and master sawmiller with a vast knowledge of local timbers
                    from throughout the whole region.

                  <CardText>
                    Joseph married Annie McAndrew Ross in 1892 and in 1902 he
                    purchased Glasgow's sawmill at Mullumbimby. He moved his
                    growing family there and began what was to become a major
                    role in the timber industry of the North Coast. He obtained
                    timber licences for large areas of forest land and later
                    other mills were built so that the timber could be processed
                    closer to its source. For a time he was in partnership with
                    a cousin, Robert Raymond Mallett, who had worked in the
                    timber industry for many years and had a fine knowledge of
                    marketing as well as species of timber. Joseph and Annie had
                    only one son, David John Hollingworth, and he was to follow
                    his father into the business. Unfortunately, Joseph
                    contracted influenza in 1919 during the epidemic and died.

                    considered too young to hold the reins. The business became
                    a company and a manager was employed. David, however,
                    continued in the business until it was sold to Standard
                    Sawmill Co. of Murwillumbah in 1964, and his son, Nicholson
                    (Nick) Hollingworth, was also employed there.

                    Nicholson (Nick) Hollingworth is the fifth generation of his
                    family to be involved with the timber industry. A book, The
                    Mullumbimby Sawmill, has taken many years to compile by
                    well-known family historian Nicholson Hollingworth. The
                    publication fills a gap by recording the many years of
                    history concerning the sawmill at Mullumbimby run mainly by
                    the Hollingworth family. As other mills in the area were
                    purchased by or amalgamated with this mill over the years we
                    also learn some of the history of those mills.
