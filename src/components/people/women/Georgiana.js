                    Georgiana McCrae was a daughter of the Duke of Gordon. In
                    Britain she was recognised as an excellent painter and in
                    1820, at the age of 16, she won a silver medal from the
                    Royal Society of Arts for her work. In 1830 Georgiana
                    married Andrew McCrae, a lawyer who initially practised in
                    Edinburgh. In 1838, he booked passage to Australia, which he
                    believed offered huge opportunities. Georgiana, unable to
                    travel at that time due to illness, is said to have raised
                    the funds to purchase passage by painting miniatures, as
                    well as receiving help from the Duke's second wife. She and
                    her children landed at Port Phillip on 1 March 1841. When
                    Georgiana arrived in Melbourne the settlement was only five
                    years old and was a virtual shanty town. The cottage her
                    husband had rented in Lonsdale Street was nothing like
                    Gordon Castle, where Georgiana had lived in her youth. The
                    cottage had an outdoor toilet, mud and animal faeces
                    underfoot and a hole in the roof for the cooking fire smoke
                    to escape. The privileged life she had led as a member of
                    the English upper class was well and truly over. In February
                    1842 they moved to Mayfield, on the Yarra River (near
                    Studley Park), designed by her and described as 'one of the
                    first superior houses erected in the Colony'. In 1843 Andrew
                    took up the 'Arthur's Seat' run near Dromana, and there
                    built a house in which the family lived from 1845 to 1851.
                    Georgiana is said to have welcomed local Aboriginal people
                    when they passed through each year. Georgiana was
                    acknowledged by other runholders for being as useful as a
                    drover among cattle and horses, and was renowned as a
                    'medicine woman'. Although her husband moved about,
                    including going to the goldfields, Georgiana remained in
                    Melbourne. There she died in 1890 at the age of 85. Today
                    she is remembered as a true Melbourne pioneer, an
                    accomplished artist and brave woman.
